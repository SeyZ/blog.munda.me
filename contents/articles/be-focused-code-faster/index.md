I love being focused when I code. That's why I try to eliminate all sources of
distractions. So, the first thing I do is to correctly configure my
environment. I prefer my keyboard than my mouse :-).

Operating system
================

I run on Linux. I (or the community) control my OS, not the opposite. More
exactly, I use the [Archlinux](http://archlinux.org "Archlinux") distribution.

Window manager
==============

I don't need any big graphical environment. I like minimalism, it avoids a lot
of useless problem. That's why I only use a window manager. I use
[Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org). The configuration files are written in
[Lua](http://lua.org). It's highly customizable, really.

Keyboard
========

I am belgian and my native language is French. However, I use US altgr-intl.
One reason is that most people who write softwares has designed default
keybindings according to a QWERTY layout.

I use a mechanical keyboard with [Cherry Black MX
switches](http://www.cherrycorp.com/english/switches/key/mx.htm).

Shell
=====

I use [Zsh](http://zsh.org) shell with the great
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework. I use
[urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) terminal and [Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) to multiplex virtual consoles.

Text editor
===========

I am on [Vim](http://www.vim.org) configured with that plugin:

* CtrlP
* delimitmate
* nerdcommenter
* powerline
* ultisnips
* yankstack
